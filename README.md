# Time_Series_Exploration
Times series exploration on Covid cases. With the number of new daily cases worldwide this will be a perfect example for
time series exploration. I will also use a techinique called Seasonal Decompostion in hopes to smooth some of the variacne
we expect to see when dealing with daily cases of a variable. 

ENJOY!!
