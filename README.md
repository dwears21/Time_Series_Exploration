# Time_Series_Exploration
Times series exploration on Covid cases. With the number of new daily cases worldwide this will be a perfect example for time series exploration. 
I will also use a technique called Seasonal Decomposition in hopes to smooth some of the variance we expect to see when dealing with daily cases 
of a variable.

ENJOY!!
